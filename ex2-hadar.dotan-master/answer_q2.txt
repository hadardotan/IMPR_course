If the center of the gaussian will not be at the (0,0) at space domain we will get after "blur_fourier" function a cyclic image.
the image will have the same blur effect but two times rotated clockwise of the four main corners of the image.
Every pixel from the input image "spread" over the Fourier image, so that after converting the gaussian matrix to the frequency domain,
the center of the kernel would be at the four corners.
by scaling the center of the gaussian to (0,0) reflects that in the frequency domain it would be at the center of the
spectrum, scaled with the zero frequency component of the Fourier transformed input image.
The result is that the original position of input image pixels changed.
