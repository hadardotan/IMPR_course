Q2: suggest how to use the workflow you have implemented in this assignment to train a network that could be used for
super-resolution. A full answer consists of a description of the corruption function, and how to properly use the
restore_image() function for this task. For this context only, you could optionally add additional operations before
calling to restore_image().

The workflow will go as followed:
1 - we will define a corruption function with noise of zero padding and with a blur of (1/2, 1, 1/2)
2 - we will train the network on sets of (small, large) images as followed:
    we will implement the corruption function on smaller versions of an image to the point it is in the size of the
    large image and then we will train the network to deblur, denoise.
    That will cause bring us a larger small image so it will be closer to the original large image.
3 - we will restore an image: we will first apply our corruption function and then will use predict on the
    model that we built.
