Q1: Describe the effect of increasing the residual blocks on its performance for each task, both quantiatively
in terms of the plot you got and qualitatively in terms of the differences in the image outputs of each model.

The effect of increasing the residual blocks is that the error is decreasing.
It effect on the images in a way that it is more accurate to predict an image when training with more residual
blocks, but, as we learned in class, it might also cause overfitting.
