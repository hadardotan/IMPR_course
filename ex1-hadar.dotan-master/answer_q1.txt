Q1:
The quantization procedure needs an initial segment division of [0..255] to segments, z.
If a division will have a gray level segment with no pixels, the procedure will crash - WHY?

ANSWER:
As we saw in the tirgul, the formula for finding q (which according to q we find z) includes a division where the
denominator in this formula s the amount of the pixels in each segment. Therefore, if the initial partition to the
z segments will include a segment with no pixels, there will be a zero division in the formula for finding q =>
the procedure will crash.
